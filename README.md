# ðŸ“¨ Spam Detection using PySpark

This project demonstrates how to build a **Spam Detection System** using **Apache Spark (PySpark)**.  
The goal is to classify text messages as **spam** or **ham (not spam)** through distributed data processing and machine learning techniques.

## ðŸš€ Overview

The notebook `spam_pyspark.ipynb` walks through a complete machine learning pipeline using PySpark:
- Data ingestion and preprocessing
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Model training with Naive Bayes
- Evaluation using accuracy and other metrics

This project is ideal for learning how to perform large-scale text classification using PySpark.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Apache Spark / PySpark**
- **Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab**
- **pandas**
- **scikit-learn** (for data preprocessing utilities)

You can install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pyspark pandas scikit-learn jupyter
